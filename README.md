#Automation
MQTT based home automation
This project demonstrates integration between Python, MQTT Broker, and Home Assistant to send real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, and PIR motion detection) and visualize it in a dashboard.
#  Home Assistant + MQTT + Python Sensor Integration

This project demonstrates real-time sensor data transmission to Home Assistant using MQTT.  
A Python script publishes temperature, humidity, and PIR sensor values to an MQTT broker, and the values are displayed in Home Assistant dashboard tiles.

---

##  Objective

- Send real sensor-like values using Python through MQTT.
- Display the values as MQTT entities on Home Assistant.
- Validate integration using MQTT Explorer.
- Submit screenshots, video proof, and documentation for assignment evaluation.
